  "Description": "The image displays a modern flat screen television placed on a wooden floor in a dimly lit room with ambient lighting predominantly from overhead light fixtures. The television screen has a large, prominent crack centered approximately in the middle, spreading out radially towards the edges, which looks like an impact mark. The background and setting suggest an indoor environment, possibly staged for demonstrating the damaged TV.",
